High-level goals for FTDI Software

We require python scripts to perform tasks callable from any python script
The afore-mentioned tasks are those which are required to perform all ROACH2 test
and configuration operations. These operations would be used for production
testing, qualification testing, field testing and general board configuration. 

These tasks are grouped by function: JTAG, I2C and GPIO

Generic JTAG Tasks
--------------------------------

scan_jtag_chain:
  scans the JTAG chain for devices present. Will return device IDs and chain location
  for all devices on chain.

Device Specific JTAG Tasks:
--------------------------------

PPC

ppc_load_program_ram:
  load a program into ppc memory and run it

FPGA

v6_configure:
  load a bitstream onto the FPGA

CPLD

cpld_configure:
  load a JED image onto the CPLD

cpld_erase:
  erase the contents of the CPLD

...

IIC Tasks
--------------------------------

iic_probe:
  lists all the devices on the iic bus

....
